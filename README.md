# CyberConnexion_Capstone

Introduction
With the everchanging Information Technology field we have moved to an era of Cloud Computing. With the cloud computing platform, we have been introduced with the shared responsibility model from the Public Cloud perspective. Now we are dealing with IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, Service as a Service, and Infrastructure as Code. With all these new concepts, securing the Cloud Platform became more challenging compared to the On-prem Data Center Facilities.
Capstone Project
The idea of the capstone project is to introduce the students to a real-world problem, with the expectations that the students will be able to solve it with minimum guidance. Students should be able to explain each decision they have made to successfully achieve the goals set by the project admin.
By solving this real-world problem, students will be able to create a portfolio and showcase their ability on a specific topic, which will help them in their professional career.
Project Scope & Synapsis
Deploy a Secure “Hybrid Cloud” environment with the following characteristics:
1. A three tier “highly available” application environment in a Production VPC
2. A Non-Prod environment
3. A Transit Gateway for routing traffic between VPCs
4. An On-Prem environment (simulated with an AWS VPC)
5. A network scanner and endpoint agents (linked a SaaS platform)
